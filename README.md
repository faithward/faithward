### 💻 I've been coding for 4+ years now and love the puzzles that come along with it. I use technology to communicate ideas and create socially-aware solutions. I hope to contribute to more community-driven projects for the greater good 🫂

**🛠️ Comfortable working with:**
- HTML/CSS and Bootstrap

- C/C++
- Java
- Bash and Vim
- Data Structures

**Projects:**
- [WordSword](wordsword.herokuapp.com), a web application built using React.js, Node.js, and Flask that returns condensed versions of user-inputted texts without sacrificing meaning. Repository available [here](https://github.com/faithward/WordSword)
- [Florida Man Mythos](floridamanymythos.com), a digital archive of cultural history tracing the origins of the "Florida Man" legend. Self-researched and built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. Repository available [here](https://github.com/faithward/floridamanphenom)
